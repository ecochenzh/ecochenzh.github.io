  abstract={Ongoing global climate change and conventional forestry have led to a dramatic increase in new forest gaps, predicted to strongly impact litter turnover and nutrient cycling. Here we synthesized 8739 paired observations to quantify the impacts of naturally occurring and artificially created gaps on litterfall, litter decomposition, and the release of carbon and nutrients. Globally, forest gaps decreased annual litterfall by 29.5\% and litter remaining carbon and phosphorus by 5.6\%, while litter decomposition increased in the 0-20\% mass loss interval. Climate and litter quality showed a major contribution to forest gap effects on litter decomposition, with gap characteristics further influencing the release of carbon and nutrients during decomposition. Our results uncovered the potential impact of escalating forest gaps on reducing litter turnover and carbon sequestration, providing support for the inclusion of gaps into global litter dynamic models to improve predictions of ecosystem material cycling responses to ongoing climate change. The increased abundance of forest gaps, influenced by climate and litter quality, could reduce annual litterfall by 29.5\% and carbon and phosphorus remaining by 5.6\%, while litter decomposition could increase in 0-20\% mass loss intervals, according to a global meta-analysis of the 8739 paired observations.},

  abstract={With over one-third of terrestrial net primary productivity transferring to the litter layer annually, the carbon release from litter serves as a crucial valve in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations. However, few quantitative global projections of litter carbon release rate in response to climate change exist. Here, we combined a global foliar litter carbon release dataset (8973 samples) to generate spatially explicitly estimates of the response of their residence time (τ) to climate change. Results show a global mean litter carbon release rate (k\$\$ k \$\$) of 0.69 year−1 (ranging from 0.09–5.6 year−1). Under future climate scenarios, global mean τ is projected to decrease by a mean of 2.7\% (SSP 1–2.6) and 5.9\% (SSP 5–8.5) during 2071–2100 period. Locally, the alleviation of temperature and moisture restrictions corresponded to obvious decreases in τ in cold and arid regions, respectively. In contract, τ in tropical humid broadleaf forests increased by 4.6\% under SSP 5–8.5. Our findings highlight the vegetation type as a powerful proxy for explaining global patterns in foliar litter carbon release rates and the role of climate conditions in predicting responses of carbon release to climate change. Our observation-based estimates could refine carbon cycle parameterization, improving projections of carbon cycle–climate feedbacks.},

  abstract = {Changes in precipitation patterns have the potential to significantly affect the global carbon (C) cycle by altering soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics. Comparing the patterns and drivers of soil C responses to precipitation changes in wet and dry forests can improve our understanding of soil carbon-water coupling. In this study, we conducted a meta-analysis to assess the effects of precipitation changes on soil dissolved organic carbon (DOC), microbial biomass carbon (MBC), SOC concentrations, and carbon dioxide (CO2) flux across a broad range of forest sites in dry and wet regions. The results showed that both the soil DOC and MBC concentrations decreased significantly (by averages of 7.8 and 7.9%, respectively) at the wet sites, but increased (by 1.2 and 10.2%, respectively) at the dry sites under increased precipitation conditions. The soil MBC concentrations decreased by 17.5% at the wet sites but by 4.1% at the dry sites under reduced precipitation conditions. The soil CO2 flux decreased by 18.9% and 14.3% at the wet and dry sites, respectively, under reduced precipitation. The responses of the soil MBC concentrations were influenced by precipitation intensity, whereas soil DOC and SOC concentration, and CO2 flux were regulated by the soil texture and climate. Clearly, soil MBC was more sensitive to increased precipitation at the dry sites than at the wet sites. Under reduced precipitation, changes in soil MBC concentration and CO2 flux were stronger at the wet sites than at the dry sites. To enhance forecasting of soil C cycles and functional alterations in a changing climate, the differing response mechanisms in dry and wet areas should be considered using process-based climate models.},

  abstract = {Forest litter accumulation can regulate the soil microclimate and alter nutrient distribution, but the effects of litter quality and seasonal differences on soil nitrogen (N) mineralization are still uncertain. The effects of litter change on the rates of net N mineralization, nitrification, and ammonification were studied through in situ incubation experiments in coniferous, mixed, and broad-leaved forests in the eastern Qinghai–Tibetan Plateau. Two litter treatments were established, one to allow the litter to enter the soil normally (remain litter) and the other to prevent the litter from entering the soil (remove litter). Soil samples were collected at the freezing (FS), thawing (TS), early growing (EGS), late growing (LGS), and early freezing (EFS) seasons during the 1.5-year incubation period. Compared to coniferous forests, the effects of litter removal on the net ammonification, nitrification, and N mineralization rates were more pronounced in broad-leaved forests, mainly during the growing and thawing seasons. Structural equation modeling indicated that microbial biomass N (MBN) was a common factor affecting the net ammonification, nitrification, and N mineralization rates in the three forest soils. The coniferous forest microbial biomass carbon (MBC), mixed forest soil moisture, broad-leaved forest soil N concentration, and C:N ratio were the unique influencing factors of the different forest types. The results showed that the effect of litter distribution on the soil net N mineralization mainly depended on forest type and season, suggesting that the litter composition and productivity in different seasons and forest types may alter the soil N cycling processes in subalpine forest ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Soil organic carbon (SOC) is the largest terrestrial organic carbon pool. Plant litter is an important source of SOC, but the knowledge gap between SOC fractions and plant litter input remains inconsistent. Here, a litter input control experiment was conducted at three subalpine forest types (coniferous forest, mixed forest, and broadleaved forest). We assessed the variations of total organic C, active organic C (easily oxidizable C, labile organic C), recalcitrant organic C, and microbial biomass C under litter input or removal. The results showed that soil total organic C decreased greatly under litter input. It was mainly caused by the change of easily oxidizable C and labile C, while the influence of recalcitrant C was small. At the same time, this effect varied among different forest types. Among them, the effect of litter input on SOC was weak and slow in the coniferous forest with low-quality litter input, while a quick effect was observed in the mixed and broadleaved forests with high-quality litter input. Microbial biomass C declined under litter input in most cases, and its variation was strongly controlled by soil temperature and freeze-thaw events. Overall, our results provide new evidence that forest type would strongly control SOC dynamics, in concert with litter quality shifts, with potential consequences for long-term C sequestration. We highlighted that litter input could reduce microbial biomass carbon which might limit the native SOC decomposition, but the loss of active C ultimately changed the SOC in the subalpine forests. It suggested that the interaction of multiple mechanisms should be considered in the study of SOC in this region.},

  abstract = {Plant litter is one of the main sources of soil humus, but which can also promote primary humus degradation by increasing microbial activity due to the higher availability of energy released, resulting in a confusing relationship between litterfall and soil humus. Therefore, an <italic>in situ</italic> incubation experiment was carried out in three subalpine forests (coniferous, mixed and broadleaved forests) on the eastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. We set up two treatments. One that allowed litterfall to enter the soil normally and the other prevented litterfall to enter the soil. Soils were sampled in October (the end of the growing season), January (the onset of the freezing season), March (the end of the freezing season), and May (the start of the growing season) from May 2017 to May 2018. By assessing the litterfall production, the content of total extracted humus, humic acid (HA) and fulvic acid (FA) in the topsoil (0–20 cm) in each incubation period, we determined the impact of litterfall on the content of humus extracted from the soil during the freezing and the growing season. Over 1-year incubation, soil total extracted humus and HA showed considerable decreases in the treatment of retained litterfall in the mixed forest but not in the coniferous or broadleaved forests. Moreover, litterfall significantly reduced the contents of soil total extracted humus and HA during the growing season in all three forests, while only reduced soil HA content in the broadleaved forest in the freezing season. The relationship between litterfall and soil extracted humic substances was greatly regulated by the seasonal dynamics of litter types and litter production in all forest types. The larger the amount of litterfall was, the more litterfall could promote the reduction of soil extracted humic substances. Compared with a single type of broadleaf or needle litter, mixed litterfall could promote a higher degradation of soil humic substances. However, broadleaf litter might lead to much greater decreases in soil humic substance than needle litter because it is more decomposable. These results indicate that the effect of litterfall on soil humic substances are mainly regulated by litter types and litter production. Moreover, the effects of litterfall on soil humic substances are more significant during the growing season than winter. This suggests that the longer growing season and a shorter winter caused by ongoing global warming may alter the relationships between litterfall and extracted humic substances, further disrupting the carbon balance of forest ecosystems in the subalpine forests.},
